# Setting up linux for programming (debian)

Here is a bash file which will help you to setup your linux (debian, ubuntu) for programming.

Basically it installs Python2 and 3, Java, C/C++ compiler, important python modules, VS Code installation.

It also install Edge browser for browsing and megaSync for cloud works.

# Working
Just copy and paste the command below in terminal and done...

```bash
  sudo apt install git
  git clone https://github.com/S0M3N/linux-setup
  cd linux-setup
  sudo chmod +x setup.sh
  ./setup.sh
```

and that's it, you are all set with your linux for programming, go on and build extremely unique and make the world think of you.

Don't forget to get your desired extension for VS Code to run your code for desirably.

Soon you will get a setup file for other distributions too and I will also modify the debian one time to time when required.

We support open source do you. With linux the user have power not the organisation.
